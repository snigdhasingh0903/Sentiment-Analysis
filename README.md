# Sentiment-Analysis
This is a Data Science oriented project where I have done the sentiment analysis of watches from amazon for product betterment
The sentiment-analysis file has the sentiment analysis of a titan watch and the sentiment-analysis2 has the analysis of a mark roller watch 
If we compare their scores(sentiment scores) at the end it is very clear that titan has a much more positive review than mark roller watch ,We can look at the graphical analysis and tell that the negative score in mark rollet is much greater than titan
